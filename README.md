# Documentation Review Workflow Using Oxygen Feedback

With the release of Oxygen Feedback version 2.0, we created this immersive live event where you will get the chance to take a deeper look at the latest features implemented in our web-based commenting platform. Also, we will showcase the use of Feedback in conjunction with Oxygen XML Editor so you can learn how to continuously improve your online documentation based on your subject matter experts (SMEs) and community feedback.

This webinar will cover the following topics:

 - Integrating Oxygen Feedback in your online documentation
 - Receiving feedback from your SMEs and end-users
 - Feedback moderation
 - User roles and user management (promote/demote users)
 - Oxygen integration - Easily update your content by accessing the comments stream directly in Oxygen
